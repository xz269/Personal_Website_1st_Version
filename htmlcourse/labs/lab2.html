	    	<pre>I have two hobbies.</pre>
	    	<p align="left"><br>I enjoy singing and listening music.<br> Since I was a child, I have found that music could heal people and that is the reason why I love listening music. Furthermore, singing helps release stress and sorrow, so when I was having a bad moon, I sang.

	    	<p align="left"><br> Moreover, swimming is another hobby of mine.<br>
			<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)">Swimming is a water based team or individual sport. Competitive swimming is one of the most popular Olympic sports, with events in freestyle, backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly. Recreational swimming is a popular low-impact form of exercise.</blockquote>I love swimming because it makes me feel free.
