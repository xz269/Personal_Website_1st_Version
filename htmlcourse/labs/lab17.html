				<p>Debut in Turin Kramer made his first appearance at the Olympic Winter Games at Turin 2006 when he was 20. It was a successful debut, as he won silver in the 5,000m. He then teamed up with the Dutch team for the team pursuit, in which the Dutch were hot favourites. But disaster struck in the semi-final against Italy, when Sven fell, taking one of his team-mates with him. The Dutch then saw off Norway to win the bronze and give Kramer a second Olympic medal.

				Over the following four years, Kramer went on to become one of the worldâ€™s top speed skaters, winning 12 world championship titles and setting several world records. Although competing over all the individual distances, it was in the 5,000m and 10,000m that he truly excelled, while he also established himself as a key figure for the Dutch in the team pursuit.
