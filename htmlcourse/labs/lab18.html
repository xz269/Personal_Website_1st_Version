					Evil twin is a term for a rogue Wi-Fi access point that appears to be a legitimate one offered on the premises, but actually has been set up to eavesdrop on wireless communications.An evil twin is the wireless version of the phishing scam. An attacker fools wireless users into connecting a laptop or mobile phone to a tainted hotspot by posing as a legitimate provider. This type of evil twin attack may be used to steal the passwords of unsuspecting users by either snooping the communication link or by phishing, which involves setting up a fraudulent web site and luring people there.

				<p id="paragraph2">
					Evil twins aren't limited to public hotspots. These attacks can occur in offices or dorms – anywhere victims might be tricked into connecting to look-alike APs. Hotspots SSIDs are just really good bait. So, if you're in your hotel room when you see an SSID that's clearly out of place – like linksys or gogoinflight – don't connect. Better yet, disable auto-connect for saved hotspot SSIDs to avoid accidental reconnects.
